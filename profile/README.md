Our application project presents a solution to encourage sustainable living habits among Indonesian people. The app aims to educate users on eco-friendly practices, encourage daily green activities, and provide insights into their environmental impact. This application will be Android-based, incorporating machine learning and cloud computing in its operation. The app can detect the type of waste being disposed of by the user and classify it into seven categories of waste. Additionally, it features educational tools and user-tracking functionalities such as recommended articles, a user dashboard, missions, and a community page.
